    <br>
    <p>Hello, my name is Marina and I am originally 
      from Chicago. I grew up in a diverse city and 
      made lifelong friends in high school. I attended 
      school in Illinois until I graduated with my 
      bachelor's degree and moved to Seattle for graduate 
      school. Though English is my native language, I 
      am proficient in Lao, Thai, and Spanish. I am a 
      certified teacher in Washington state and spent a 
      few years as a math and science teacher at 
      Ballard High School, where I also founded their 
      competitive Dance Team program. I have spent the 
      last quarter of my life as a caregiver to various 
      friends and family members and lent support where 
      needed. My passions are dance, music, and animals. 
      I especially love dogs and salsa dancing.</p>
